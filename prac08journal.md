# Week 9 Prac 08

## Learning Activities
I determined the following theory that I use in my learning by researching different learning theories and how they are tested. 
The spacing effect is the theory that spacing out learning over time can improve retention and recall of information compared to doing it all in one session.

To test this theory, I divided my learning sessions into spaced intervals with rest periods in between. For example, I went over the pre-lecture content for Week 8 on the Friday of Week 7 of the Study Period. 
Then, I watched the live lecture that highlights important topics of the content and includes more example demonstrations on the Monday of Week 8. Therefore, I already had a base knowledge of the Week 8 content, and I was able to ask any questions during the live lecture time. I was also able to revise some aspects of the content that are of high importance. 

On the Tuesday of week 9, I revised the learning activities needed for that weekâ€™s content in the practical session. During this session, I revised the key aspects that I needed to further research to complete the practical activity. These activities helped me develop the skills required to complete the practical assessment piece to obtain the necessary knowledge I needed to succeed in CMS.

By Friday of week 9, I completed the practical assessment by utilizing my research skills and the content knowledge I already had to gain a better understanding of the content and apply it to the practical activity.

## Estimated Hours

Approximately 4 hours. 

## Content Insights
The spacing effect is a cognitive phenomenon that suggests that spacing out learning over time can improve retention and recall of information compared to massed practice, where all learning occurs in one session. 
The spacing effect highlights the importance of repeating learning material over time to ensure long-term retention and recall. This effect also suggests that the timing of repetition is crucial for optimal learning. Spacing out learning over time allows for better consolidation of information in memory.

The spacing effect indicates that optimal spacing intervals may depend on the type of material being learned and the individual learner's characteristics. For simple information, shorter spacing intervals may be more effective, while for complex information, longer intervals may be needed.

Overall, the spacing effect provided me with insights into how I can structure learning activities to promote optimal retention and recall of information. I was able to reinforce memory traces and reduce forgetting by doing more frequent study sessions where I revised some key aspects that I struggled with. 


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
While it is possible to test this theory with only one person, it may not be as robust as a larger study with more participants. This exercise did help me reflect on how I learn and how to optimize my learning outcomes. I gained more out of the smaller and more frequent study sessions as what I previosly gained out of just doing it all in one session. I found that I was able to absord the content better and I felt motivated to do 1-2 hour session rather than an entire day on one subject. I found that I didn't get bored or frustrated when only doing a little bit at a time, which also felt empowering, as it was managable to do 2 hours of content at a time and not 6 hours in one go.

The spacing effect theory can help individuals better retain and apply new skills and knowledge. By spacing out learning over time, individuals can reinforce their memory traces and reduce the likelihood of forgetting important information. This can be especially useful in jobs that require ongoing learning and skill development, like in the IT industry, where technology is always changing and developing.

People can, therefore, improve their learning outcomes by using the spacing effect, which can, in turn, make them more employable. By incorporating these theories into their learning strategies, employees can develop stronger memory traces, retain new information more effectively, and better understand complex concepts. This can help them to be more productive and effective in their jobs, leading to greater success and opportunities for advancement.
