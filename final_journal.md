## Content Insights
- Throughout CP3402, I learned various skills related to CMS and web development, such as creating websites using WordPress and understanding the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- One significant insight was the importance of separating form and function in web development. By maintaining a clear separation between HTML (content/function) and CSS (style/presentation), websites become more maintainable and adaptable to different devices.
- Another valuable insight was the effectiveness of a structured learning approach. Rather than passively watching videos, I found that engaging in active learning, such as watching videos for a short period and then immediately practicing what I learned, kept me more engaged and enhanced my understanding and retention of the material.
- Additionally, I discovered the value of seeking additional learning resources beyond the practical assignments. Exploring LinkedIn Learning courses and other online tutorials helped me gain a deeper understanding of the topics covered in the course, especially in areas that were not extensively covered in the practical tasks.
- I also gained familiarity with Markdown syntax while creating this final learning journal. Markdown is a simple yet powerful markup language that is widely used for project documentation and is valuable for conveying information effectively.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- Through this course, I have developed valuable skills in CMS and web development, which are highly sought-after in the industry.
- I realized the importance of continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices in web development.
- The structured learning approach I adopted during this course, combining tutorials, practical work, and additional resources, proved to be effective in deepening my understanding and practical skills.
- I have recognized the need to balance theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience, as practical implementation enhances comprehension and problem-solving abilities.
- Reflecting on my learning journey, I am confident that the skills and insights gained from CP3402 have enhanced my employability and prepared me for future roles in web development and CMS management.

By documenting my learning experiences, insights, and reflections in this final learning journal, I have not only improved my self-reflection and learning processes but also created a valuable resource for future reference.
