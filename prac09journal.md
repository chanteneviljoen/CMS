# Week 10 Prac 09

## Learning Activities
I watched YouTube videos to learn how to install, open, and use Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet (Sass). 

I researched and read online articles about Sass to gain a better understanding of the language and its features. Then, I implemented the steps described in the articles by practicing with Sass on my own.

To get hands-on experience with Sass, I practiced creating and designing CSS and SCSS files using an editor like Visual Studio Code and Notepad++.

As I became more proficient with Sass, I incorporated advanced features like variables, nesting, mixing, and extend/inheritance into my CSS and SCSS files to write more efficient and organized code and create more sophisticated designs.

## Content Insights
Sass enables developers to write more efficient and organized CSS code by allowing the use of variables, nesting, mixins, and extend/inheritance. This makes it easier to maintain and update CSS code, which can save time and effort in the long run. Additionally, Sass allows for easier and more flexible customization of CSS styles. With the use of variables and mixins, developers can create reusable style components that can be easily modified and applied to different parts of a website.

Sass can help improve website performance by reducing the size of CSS files. The use of Sass's nesting and extend/inheritance features can reduce the need for repeated CSS rules, resulting in smaller file sizes and faster page load times.
