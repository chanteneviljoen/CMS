# Week 3 Prac 02

## Learning Activities

This practical demonstrated how to create a website for my start-up using Joomla! and hosting it on AWS Lightsail. I was confronted with an unfamiliar interface as I have never done CMS before and did not know how to host a website either. This was challenging and required me to make use of the resources listed below to learn how to use Joomla! and overcome the difficulty I had customising the content. I also did not manage to host my website properly as the HTTPS did not configure properly for the website.

## Estimated Hours**

Approximately 5 hours.


## Content Insights

Using a CMS for the first time helepd me broaden my understanding of what the process is of creating and hosting a website. It exposed me of new ways of carrying this task out and a new interface to create websites. I was able of gaining more knowledge of content management systems and the purpose they serve in providing more effective ways in managing web content. I was able to use trial and error in working with a new interface and spend time learning now to edit the themes and layout of the content in a more sophisticated way.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Using a CMS can provide a more effecient way of managing Web content and can serve a great purpose in a company if a website requires constant updating. A CMS can offer a very effective way to managing content with multiple editors and allow multiple people to contribute. This knowledge can help me apply it in the workplace to better content management that is specific to a business and improve the effeciency of staff, ultimatley benefitting the business and its clients. By being able to find more manageable way to keep web content updated, resources can be redirected to other areas of priority. Being able to apply these skills can therefore help me create new solutions for clients by staying up to date with eerging technologies.
