# Week 6 Prac 05

## Learning Activities
In the past week I used the Developer Resources from WordPress to gain a better understanding of child themes and how they work. This resource explained the relationship between parent and child themes and how to create a child theme.  <br> 

I also used the site from wpbeginner to read about child themes from another perspective which focussed more on how to customise the child theme. This site included a lot of other links which when into more detail on plugins that can be used to create child themes. It also included resources on PHP and CSS that I found useful to refresh my memory on the languages used in themes. <br> 

The demo in the youtube video helped me visualise how a child theme works and how it forms part of a parent theme. I was able to draw on the demo to.

## Content Insights
The functions.php file is the template included in a WordPress theme that acts like a plugin that is automatically activated with the current theme. This file uses PHP code to add features on the site like adding widgets to the footer. I found that its best practise to change the theme without changing the functionality of the site or change the plugins without affecting the design of the site.<br> 

Editing the functions.php is not a good idea as it edits the functions file will be lost when the theme gets updated or changed, and coding errors can lock you out of the site or make it disappear.<br> 

Plugins are more frequently used to edit child themes as it allows you to pull across the structure files from the parent theme. <br> 

Cascading style sheets are an easy way to create a global format of pages using a very simple language. This is mainly used for html elements on a web page which makes it very useful when creating a theme as css code can easily harmonise the style of a page and apply it to other pages as well.<br> 

Templates can also be used in a theme to customise the layout of a single page within a theme - that controls the overall appearance of the site made up of files, and can include template files.<br> 


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The benefit of having a child theme is to allow you to modify the parent theme without losing the customisations as it can be lost in a change or update to the parent theme. Using a child theme would make it simple to use a cohesive ‘look’ to a website that can be applied to different websites. <br> 

This could be useful to save time in the industry when a client is developing a series of intranet websites for different departments. This allows a developer to customise the appearance of a site to suit each department but still using the same design elements like the same layout, fonts, colours, etc. Developing more efficient ways of creating web solutions will save the money, time and resources spent on creating the solution and more time to earn back the revenue spent.<br>
