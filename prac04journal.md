# Week 5 Prac 04

## Learning Activities
I used a website by Indeed to gain a better understanding of development environments, in particular that a local environments are useful when you don’t have access to client servers or internet. 
The Themeisle site helped me understand that local hosting involves using my computer as a server that is set up with a local web stack or virtual sandbox environment only to be accessed on that device.
I watched a YouTube video of a demo which explained the different features of Local.

## Content Insights
Based on last week’s feedback, I was able to improve the design of my website. I incorporated a more focused design by placing important and intriguing information above the page fold, as well as improving the content of the website to be about the product I am advertising rather that the business. 
Using a local environment showed many benefits like easy configuration to any IDE. When making a mistake locally, the online website remains the same until updated so the mistake is not on the live website. This provides a more robust way of web development as the site will remain unchanged while developing and testing new features until it is pushed to the production environment. I could use this environment to test new themes and layouts of my site to compare to the live website without loosing any of my work.
I found that the YouTube demo was helpful to go into more detail of the features that Local can provide as a local environment and to see how it could be used. Even though it cleared some confusion for me, I found it more useful to read the blog as it was easier to refer back to content or skip ahead if it was unrelated to what I was doing. I found it almost more time consuming to watch a video than to read the blog as it was faster to skim through content, but could save time debugging if something went wrong by having prior knowledge.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Using different environments for web development provides a client of easier ways to customise their website as the developer can modify and test different things before actually pushing it to the live site. This is a professional way of implementing changes as the client can provide feedback, the developer cannot break the live site and customers can continue using the live site without having any issues.
Getting feedback and following through with implementing it can show initiative from a developer as they can design the best solution customised to the audience and business. It is critical to test the site with the client and get their input as they will be using it and their profits depend on marketing their services online.
