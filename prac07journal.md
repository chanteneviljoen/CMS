# Week 8 Prac 07

## Learning Activities
Watch YouTube videos on how PHP is used and where to apply it, including how PHP is used in Wordpress sites for editing both posts and source code  
Researched online turtorials on PHP and practised exercised to gain a better understanding on how to use PHP code like echo, if/else statements, for loop, creating a function, using include.  
Used videos and tutorials to implement PHP code in basic websites using HTML, including loops, decision making statements and functions.  
Researched the difference between staging and developing environments.

## Content Insights
PHP is a widely used general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development to embed HTML and CSS code.
For example, instead of lots of commands to display a web page using HTML, I could use HTML pages that contain embedded PHP code with a functionality element.
The PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions that allow you to jump in and out of the code without impacting on the HTML code. This allows you to add in a functional element, like a log in prompt, onto a website, to submit an input that can be checked in a database. Without overcomplicating a basic HTML site, PHP code can therefore be used to add in elements like a log in screen to allow access for certain users.  
  
The videos also allowed be to distinguish the difference in code editing features in WordPress through the demonstration that showed the block editor to paste code into, as opposed to the code editor view where I am able to manipulate the code of the entire page.  
In web development, the staging websites are almost ready for publishing, and you likely already have a live site, meaning youâ€™re using that environment to test minor changes. A test website, on the other hand, is a blank canvas used to test completely new designs or functionality to see how they operate. This typically allows developers that are working on a website to use a staging environment to test small pre-approved changes or updates to ensure they work before pushing them to the live world.  
  

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
A mix of documentation and videos continues to be my preferred style of learning by combining visual elements to content from a few different sources. I found that an interactive resource like W3schools kept me intrigued in learning how to manipulate code by being able to test small blocks of code, rather than just trying to make sense of text.  
Tutorial videos helps be visualize how the code should be working, which by just reading a resource, it would be much harder to imagine what it should look like if there are no example outputs in the content.  
I found open AI useful when troubleshooting my code, especially when it was just basic HTML code. I was able to use the AI to check the code for any errors that could have easily been missed, in particular, syntax errors are my most common hurdle as I often forget to close tags or use commas.  
  
PHP developers most often focus on developing websites, applications, and programs which is in high demand in the industry. I find that web development is expanding its capabilities and companies are seeking employees with PHP programming skills to keep up with the market demand for online interfaces. Employees would have to be made accountable to design and implement solutions to meet client needs by programming and troubleshooting web interfaces, and expanding on them by programming applications as well.
