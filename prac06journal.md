# Week 7 Prac 06

## Learning Activities
I have downloaded Visual Studio to edit code for our starter theme as I discussed with my team members.  
I have contributed to creating our resource channels to set up our team and start the planning of our project.  
I particular, I have contributed to setting up our Trello board to record our strategies and organise our tasks.  
During our practical, we were able to communicate our ideas and discuss how we want to set up our team for success in an initial team meeting. The most important part that we set up was our GitHub repo.  
I was able to use the resources to help clear my confusion about the environments that we need to set up.

## Content Insights
Setting up an IDE to edit foundational code is important to create a robust environment as it needs to be easy to use a platform to maniplutae the source code. As this is a timely process, with a GitHub repo, the team can easily organise each team member's work and record all the changes made to the code. Using Visual Studio and GitHib, each team member can set up a local environment to do individual work to then combine together in the Repo in GitHub so the team can delegate tasks between members to complete on their own. By then combining our work we can create an efficient workflow to create our theme by collating different elements together in the repo, rather that one person being responsible for the entire theme.  
By setting up our Trello board, the team could establish one platform to record all tasks and expectations in one place. While the other communication channels are to discuss these tasks, the board allows the team to clearly allocate tasks to everyone, as well as set up group expectations and project management details. This allows everyone to have a reference point so that no information gets lost in the other channels.  
During the initial team meeting, the team members all voiced their ideas in an isightful way that showed that everyone is keen to put in the effort to create a viable solution to the problem domain. The team were able to communicate their ideas clearly and compromise on other ideas to better accomodate the other members. This created a motivated work environment in the team as everyone set clear expectations that they want to get tasks done efficiently and that everyone is considered a valuable team member as strengths and weaknesses vary from person to person.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Being able to work in a team shows valuable characteristics of an employee as it shows that they can communicate their ideas, use problem solving skills to develop a solution together and use their people skills to accomodate to all members of the team so that everyone is considered equally. Team work can pose many challenges, and being able to be an effecient team member, allows them to show that any team scenario is seen as a new challenge to master, rather than a burden.  
As so many workplace scenarios evolve around teamwork, it is an important skill to know how to effecietly manage yourself in a team and what works bets for you. By knowning your strangths and weaknesses, clear communication strategies and to keep an open mind to all possibilities can set yourself up to work effectively as a team. It is important to remember that 'team work makes dream work' as almost all workplace environments rely on key members of a team and that working in teams is not always a burden. If a team is not 'pulling its weight' then your people skills need to be utilised to communicate your point of view and better manage the scenario so that the team can succeed.
