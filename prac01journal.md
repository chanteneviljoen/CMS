# Week 2 Prac 01 

## Learning Activities

This practical jumped back to basics. I had to use some resources like W3Schools for a refresher on HTML code and how to use code to present the website content in a responsive and professional manner. I also used GitHub pages for the first time and learned how to use the different features of GitHub more effectively. Online resources helped me gain inspiration for my website as well by looking at different layouts and content types, which helped me determine the best fit for the purpose of the website.

## Estimated Hours**

Approximately 4 hours.


## Content Insights

Refreshing my memory of HTML helped me manipulate the content of the website to create a more appealing design. Although the website is basic, I could use links, colours, alignment, etc. to make the website more vibrant to avoid white space. I used CSS to manipulate the visual appearance of the website in a separate page for better functionality and readability of my code. This helped me create a uniform design and avoid unnecessary time trying to fix errors. I also gained a new understanding of simple hosting features on GitHub which makes it easy to test a basic website, as well as learning a new language, Markdown, to record my journal.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Updating and refreshing my knowledge ultimately empowers me to expand my capabilities in software development. This is a great benefit to my employability as I am confident in programming languages that can be useful in web design. I also used good programming practices like insuring my code is readable, responsive and robust to ensure that I can develop projects efficiently and ensure that they provide a successful solution to the problem domain. Reflecting on my task outcomes also helps me find areas of improvement and how I can overcome challenges which can greatly benefit me when I need to work on large projects that can have complex programs.
